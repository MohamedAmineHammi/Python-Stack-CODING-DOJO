Recognize Python
Objectives
Use what you know already to identify concepts in a new language
The goal of this assignment is for you to use your knowledge of programming concepts and identify them in a new language.  There are two code snippets provided below.  One is a list of programming concepts, and the other is some Python code.  In the Python file, file.py, write a comment in the same line of the code with the corresponding concept from the file.txt file.

Comments can made with either a # (single line) or triple set of """ (multiline) at the beginning and the end of the comment.  

# this is a single line comment
"""
This is
a multiline
comment
"""copy
Below is an example of the expected output. If there are more than one concept that is covered on the same line, add them both

my_new_favorite_language = 'Python' # variable declaration, initialize stringcopy
Remember to only use what you already know. If you don't know, this is a great opportunity to utilize the 20 min rule and ask a fellow cohort mate. All of these concepts will be explained in the modules to follow.
